    details: |
    - role: Final Project Studies: |
        - Automatic detection and analysis of parallel growth among neural dendritic branches by developed automatic quantification 
        of the ratio in the neuronal networks and compared its value to that generated by combinatorial random growth simulation of
        dendritic branches. Using Python advanced frameworks, OpenCV libraries for segmentation process and GUI (PyQt4).
        - The project is a part of a manuscript in preparation, that will be publish soon, 
        by Prof. Danny Baranes Head of Molecular Biology Department and Dr. Rafael Mines, Physics Department, Ariel University. 
        
    - role: Android application 'Carpool-U': |
        - An application for social hitchhiking where you can search and share rides for students 
        and faculty members from a specific university. 
        - Using Android Studio and Firebase, NoSQL database type, to save information and publication.
          
    - role: Neuro-computational: |
        - A Simulation of sending electrical signals in neurons by designing a simulator of a leaky integrate 
        and fire neuron as a "bucket", when it reaches to the max capacity the threshold function is activating. 
        - Using java.
